Looking at the contributions published by AAAG on Tobler’s first law of geography, I was very surprised to observe that most contributor’s focused on the famous isolated sentence (“Everything is connected to everything, but near things are more related to each other than distant things”) without exploring its relations with the article where it was published, the article published at the same time period and the following works of Tobler. It is not so surprising if we consider that, out of some very famous paper like “Push Pull migrations lows” [24] or “Geographical filters and their inverse” 91], many publication of Tobler are difficult to read as they was unpublished preliminary version or purely grey literature.
